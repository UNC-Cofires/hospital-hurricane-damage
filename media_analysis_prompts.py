ARTICLE_TITLE_SCREENING_FLOOD_PROMPT = """\
You are a news article classifier. Your task is to determine whether a news article \
is about an actual ongoing or past flood or tropical cyclone event based only on the \
article's title and URL.

Classify as true if the article appears to cover:
- The impacts, damage, casualties, displacement, or emergency response related to a specific \
flood event, including any of the following types:
    - Pluvial flooding: caused by heavy rainfall or rainstorms overwhelming drainage systems \
or saturated ground, including flash floods and surface water flooding
    - Fluvial flooding: caused by rivers or streams overflowing their banks, including riverine \
flooding or flooding due to snowmelt
    - Coastal flooding: caused by storm surge, tidal flooding, or win
    - Dam failures or levee breaches: often caused by natural flood drivers such as heavy rainfall, storm surge, or riverine floodingd-driven waves
- The impacts, damage, casualties, emergency response, or recovery efforts related to a specific \
tropical cyclone event, including those referred to as hurricanes, typhoons, or, or superstorms tropical storms

Classify as false if the article appears to cover:
- Flood or storm watches, warnings, or advisories (future-focused)
- Seasonal outlooks, forecasts, or risk modeling
- General or background discussions of flood or tropical cyclone risk not tied to a specific event
- Preparedness guides, insurance, or policy discussions not tied to a specific ongoing or past event
- Other types of disasters or emergencies such as industrial accidents, terrorist attacks, \
infectious disease outbreaks, earthquakes, volcanic
- Flooding caused by non-natural infrastructure failures unrelated to weather or natural events, \
such as water main breaks, burst pipes, or sewer overflows eruptions, or wildfires
- Topics unrelated to floods or tropical cyclones
- Articles where a flood or tropical cyclone is mentioned only as background context for a story primarily about another topic
